# Frontend Plan

This document outlines the strategy, technology stack, and feature implementation plan for the League Manager web user interface.

---

## I. Technology Stack

* **Framework:** **React**. It's the industry standard for building modern, interactive, and scalable single-page applications (SPAs).
* **Build Tool:** **Vite**. It provides an extremely fast and modern development experience with instant server start and Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**. A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development of modern, responsive user interfaces without writing custom CSS.
* **State Management:** For a project of this size, we will start with React's built-in state management tools (`useState`, `useContext`). If complexity grows, we can introduce a lightweight global state manager like **Zustand**.
* **API Communication:** We will use a modern data-fetching library like **TanStack Query (React Query)** to handle API requests, caching, and state synchronization with the backend. This simplifies data fetching, loading states, and error handling.

## II. Development Strategy

1. **API as the Contract:** The backend's OpenAPI (Swagger) specification will serve as the definitive "source of truth" for all API endpoints and data structures.
2. **Parallel Development:** The frontend can be developed in parallel with the backend. Once an endpoint is defined in the Swagger spec, the frontend can be built against it.
3. **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI will be broken down into small, reusable components (e.g., `TeamCard`, `FixtureListItem`, `StandingsTable`) for maintainability and consistency.
4. **Mobile-First Design:** All UI components will be designed and styled for mobile screens first, then scaled up for tablet and desktop views.

## III. Feature Implementation Plan

The frontend implementation will follow the backend's phased roadmap.

### Phase 1: Public-Facing Views

* **Goal:** Create the read-only pages that anonymous users can see.
* **Pages/Components:**
  * A `Standings` page that fetches data from `GET /api/leaguetable` and displays it in a clean, responsive table.
  * A `TopScorers` page that fetches from `GET /api/topscorers`.
  * A `Fixtures` page that shows upcoming matches and past results, fetching from `GET /api/fixtures`.

### Phase 2: User Authentication & Management

* **Goal:** Implement the user login flow and the initial team management features.
* **Pages/Components:**
  * A `Register` page that uses the `POST /api/auth/register` endpoint.
  * A `Login` page that uses `POST /api/auth/login`, stores the returned JWT securely (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie or local storage), and sets up the API client to send the token with all future requests.
  * A `CreateTeam` page for registered users.
  * A basic `Dashboard` for authenticated users.
  * An admin-only `ApprovalQueue` page to view pending teams and results.

### Phase 3 & 4: Advanced Features

* **Goal:** Build out the interactive features for team leaders and players.
* **Pages/Components:**
  * A detailed `TeamManagement` dashboard for Team Leaders.
  * Forms for `ResultSubmission`, `PlayerRosterManagement`, and `AttendanceTracking`.
  * An admin-only `FixtureGenerator` tool.
